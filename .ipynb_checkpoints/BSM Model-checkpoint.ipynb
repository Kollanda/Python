    "# The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model \n",
    "[Louis Bachelier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier) published the first known mathematically rigorous option valuation model in 1900. His work was less groundbreaking than one would assume. Especially since Bachelier developped the first mathematical model of [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion#History) in his paper. This random process is named after botanist [Robert Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(botanist,_born_1773) who described how grains of pollen of the plant Clarkia pulchella suspend in water under a microscope. [Thorvald Thiele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorvald_N._Thiele) independently described the process 20 years prior to Bachelier's work in statistical applications. [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cber_die_von_der_molekularkinetischen_Theorie_der_W%C3%A4rme_geforderte_Bewegung_von_in_ruhenden_Fl%C3%BCssigkeiten_suspendierten_Teilchen) brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists and mainstream academia in 1905. [Jean Baptiste Perrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Perrin) received his Nobel Price for Physics for work based on the foundations of Brownian motion. \n",

    "The main innovation of the BSM model is essentially the <mark>no-arbitrage</mark> approach, applied to a continuous time process. However, before explaining the model, it is useful to explain general concepts to build on the intuition behind the more complex BSM model. "

    "<b>Tip: </b>   \n",
    "That's why you can think of it as \"free money\". However, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between arbitrage and great investment opportunities. An arbitrage is certainly a great investment opportunity but a great investment opportunity need not be arbitrage. For example, investing $\\dollar$1 for a chance to get either nothing for a 1% chance or $\\dollar$1 Milllion for a 99% chance is definitely a great investment opportunity but it does not fulfill any of the two requirements for arbitrage. \n",

    "<b>Fundamental Rules for an arbitrageur:</b>    \n",
    "Rule #1: Do not use your own money   \n",
    "Rule #2: Do not take any price risk\n",
    "</div>   \n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrageur frequently needs to borrow money to satisfy Rule #1. This also means the arbitrageur does not spend the proceeds from short selling but invest them at the risk free interest rate. Rule #2 is concerned only with market price risk in a simplified context. Meaning liquidity risk, counterparty risk, aspects like [centralized clearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_counterparty_clearing) or daily [mark-to-market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp) are not covered and beyond the scope of this section. Transcation costs are also neglected for simplicity without loss of generality. If transcation costs exist, you will have a price band within which there is no arbitrage and not as single no arbitrage price. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying idea is that you cannot create money today with no risk or future liability. This approach is built on the <mark> law of one price</mark>, which states that if two investments have the same or equivalent future cashflows, then these two investments should have the same price because they are perfect substitutes for each other. A simple thought expirement explains why this should hold. If the law of one price is violated, someone could buy the cheaper asset and sell the more expensive, resulting in a gain at no risk, and with no commitment of capital. Furthermore, this action drives down the price of the expensive asset (which is sold) and increases the price of the cheaer asset (which is bought). Therefore, the price will eventually converge and no arbitrage will be reinstated. Note that this does not require for all market players to have perfect knowledge. It is suffcient that the size of the transactions moves the market. Since an arbitrageur gains riskless profit with this transaction, a single individual is basically enough as the transaction can be repeated over and over again until the arbirtage opportunity disappears.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The law of one price is built on the <mark> value additivity</mark> principle, which states that the value of a portfolio is simply the sum of the values of each instrument held in the portfolio. Assume there are two assets. Asset A is a risk free zero coupon bond paying $\\dollar$100 in one year and is prices at 95.2381 ($\\dollar$100/1.05). Asset B is a portfolio of 105 units of asset A. Thereofore, it will pay $100*105 = 10500$ in one year. If asset b is priced today at 9500, an astute investor will release that $10500/1.05 = 10000 > 9500$. Therefore, the portfolio does not equal its parts and buying asset B is cheaper than buying 105 units of asset A. An arbitrageur would sell 105 units of asset A for a price of 95.2381 each and buy asset B for 9500, generating a risk free profit of 500 today ($95.2381*105 = 10000$) and net $\\dollar$0 in one year from today because cash inlfow for asset B matches cash outflow for the 105 units of asset A sold.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A second principle is <mark> dominance</mark>. Any financial asset with a riskfree profit in the future must have a positive price today. Therefore, the price of any 2 risk-free securities with the same timing and payoffs must be the same. If not, there will be a dominant trading strategy that costs the same as the other one, but which is always guaranteed to out-perform it.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that arbitrage opportunities are transitory. Prices will adjust until there are no arbitrage opportunities.    \n",

    "<b>Tip: Implication for Fixed Income securities</b>   \n",
    "Any Fixed Income security can be thought of as a portfolio of zero coupon bonds. A 5 year 2% Treasury issue is for example a package of eleven zero-coupon instruments (10 semiannual coupon payments and one pricipal value payment at maturity). Dealers are able to seperate the cashflows into zero coupon securities via a process called <mark>[stripping](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-stripping.asp)</mark>. These instruments are called <mark>[STRIPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystrips.asp)</mark> (an acronym for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities). The opposite process is called <mark>reconstitution</mark>. Arbitrage profits are possible when the value additivity principle does not hold. \n",

The classic BSM model is only modelling <mark>[European options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_style)</mark>, which are <mark>path-independent</mark>. A European option can only be exercised at expiration. In contrast, an <mark> American Option</mark> can be exercised prior to expiration. The intermediate between a European optionand an American option is called a <mark> Bermudan</mark> option.

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> In formulas, the exercise price is often denoted by X, and the notation for the strike price is usually K. This choice probably owes its origin to a 19th-century Baseball reporter who simply ran out of letters [Henry Chadwick](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-does-k-stand-for-a-strikeout-in-baseball). Traders frequenty say the option is struck at the strike price.  \n",

    "$p_T = max(0,X - S_T)$    \n",
    "When the option is expiring, there is no uncertainty left and the price must equal the market value obtained from exercising it or letting it expire. Technically, European options do not have exercise values prior to expiration because they cannot be exercised until expiration. Nonetheless, there is a value attached to the right to exercise at expiration obtained by entering the option.  Specifically, there will be an element known as <mark>time value</mark>, which is always non-negative because of the asymmetry of option payoffs at expiration. At expiration, time value will be zero. Therefore, the option will loose value over time, which is called <mark> [theta decay](https://www.investopedia.com/university/option-greeks/greeks4.asp)</mark> or <mark>bleeding</mark>.

    "Consider a one-period binomial process for an aset priced at S. Each dot in the [binomial lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model) is called a <mark>node</mark>. At the time t=0, there are only two possible future paths in the binomial process. An up move, $S^+$ and a down move $S^-$, termed <mark>arcs</mark>. \n",

    "which correspond to one plus the rate of return. The magnitudes of the up and down factors depend on the volatility of the underlying. In general, higher volatility l result in higher up values and lower down values. If you assume that there are no costs or benefits from owing the underlying instrument (no dividends for example), you consider the following transcations. If you write a call option, you receive money at time t=0 and you may have to pay out money at expiry. To hedge this, you will need to take a position that will make money if the underlying goes up. This can be done by buying h units of the underlying. The symbol h is used because it represents a hedge ratio. Consider the following transactions:    \n",

    "The hedge ratio is such that the investor is indifferent to the underlying going up or down. It is the value of the call if the underlying goes up, minus the  value of the call if the underlying goes down, divided by the value of the underlying if it goes up, minus the value of the underlying if it goes down. The numerator contains the option, the denominator the underlying. Because call prices are positively related to changes in the underlying price, h must be non-negative. If r denotes the period risk free interest rate, the present value (PV) is equal to $\\frac{1}{(1+r)}$. Depending on c, h and S, the investor may either need to borrow or lend to make sure that future net cashflows are zero.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the net portfolio has positive value, an arbitrageur will engage in this strategy and push the call price down (remember the setup is to write an option) und the underlying up (by buying S) until the net is no longer positive. Similarly, if the net portfolio has net negative value, the arbitrageur would buy calls and sell short the underlying. Therefore, within a single period binomial model, the condition $+c -hS-PV(-hS^-+c^-) = 0 = c-hS-PV(-hS^+=c^+)$ must hold. Consequently, the no arbitrage approach leads to the following single period call option valuation equation: $c=hS+PV(-hS^-+c^-)$ or equivalently $c=hS+PV(-hS^++c^+)$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, being long a call option is equivalent to owning h shares of stock, partially financed, where the financed amount is $PV(-hS^-+c^-)$ which is $\\frac{(-hS^-+c^-)}{(1+r)}$. \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> \n",
    "This equation is foundational to understanding more complex option valuation models like the BSM model where we also observe two components, the stock component and the bond component. How the BSM model can be interpreted as a dynamically managed portfolio of stock and zero coupon bonds will be explained below. The equivalent number of underlying shares is $N(d_1)>0$ for calls and $-N(-d_1)<$ for puts. Likewise, the equivalent number of bonds is $-N(-d_2)<0$ for calls and $N(-d_2)$ for puts, but more on that later.\n",

    "It should be clear now that the no arbitrage approach is a replicating strategy. A call is synthetically replicated with the underlying and financing. A similar exercise leads to the hedge ratio for put:  \n",

    "What was shown to this point is called to no-arbitrage approach. The same result can be obtained as the present value of a unique expectation of the option payoff. The so called <mark> expectations approach</mark> is usually easier to compute. Consider the following formulas:  \n",

    "<b>Tip:</b> \n",
    "The expectations approach to option valuation looks similar to the discounted cashflow approach to securities valuation but there are two fundamental differences:    \n",
    "1) The probability is objectively determined and not based on an investor's personal views. Therefore, it is often called <mark>[risk-neutral probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-neutral_measure)</mark> and as such it is not a true probability of up or down moves. It is simply a result of the no arbitrage process, not an assumption about risk preferences, which relates to point 2.     \n",
    "2) The discount rate is not risk adjusted but the risk free rate. Usually, investors are risk averse but the underlying price already incorporates risk premia. Therefore, options implicitely account for risk aversion.    \n",
    "The expectations approach is often seen as superior to the <mark>discounted cashflow</mark> approach because both the subjective future exectation and the subjective risk-adjusted discount rate have been replaces with more objective measures. \n",
    "</div>  \n",
    "\n",
    "The future value FV is simply the reciprocal of the present value PV. $FV(1) = \\frac{1}{PV(1)}$, therefore if PV = 1/(1+r) FV = (1+r). In other words, the option value today is simply the present value of the expected terminal option payoffs:    \n",

    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)    \n",
    "where $\\pi = (1+r -d)/(u-d) = (1.06-0.9)/(1.1-0.9)=0.8 $. Using this information, and assuming the expected value of the option is 15.85 (see below for an explanation of where this value comes from), we can calculate the present value of the call option today as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$c = PV[\\pi c^ + (1-\\pi)c^-] = (0.8*15.85 +0.2*0)/1.06 = \\dollar11.96$    \n",
    "\n",
    "It is appropriate to discuss <mark>delta</mark> at this stage. The delta of an option is the ratio of the change in the price of the option to the change in the price of the underlying. Therefore, it measures the sensitivity of the option price with respect to a change in the price of the underlying. Later, we will reconsider this alongside other greeks. In this particular example, the value of the delta of the call option being considered is    \n",
    "- $\\frac{15.85-0}{110-90} = 0.7925$.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Delta corresponds to the number of units of the underlying that we should hold for each option shorted in order to create a riskless hedge. This rsikless hedge is sometimes referred to as <mark>delta hedging</mark> and if you are completely hedged, the overall position has a delta of zero, which is often referred to as being <mark>delta neutral</mark>. It is important to realize that the position only remains delta neutral for a relatively short period of time because delta changes. \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> \n",
    "Do not take the delta calculated in this example very serious. Usually an ATM options has a delta of approximately 50. The reason why we are so far of is that delta is a simply approximation of the change, a first order derivative. Option payoffs are non linear. Therefore, the value is only reliable for small changes in the price of the underlying. In our example here, we have a change or $\\pm10$ which is a very large change. Also, when delta changes, the hedge has to be adjusted, or <mark> rebalanced</mark>. This is where <mark>gamma</mark> comes into play, but we will postpone this discussion for now.  \n",

    "We now have enough basic knowledge to get into the details of the BSM model. As already explained in the introducation, the BSM model is essentially the <mark>no-arbitrage</mark> approach, applied to a continuous time process, which is equivalent to a binomial model in which the lenght of the time step essentially approaches zero. We showed above that the binomial process with a \"large\" number of steps converges to the normal distribution. Recall that the no-arbitrage approach requires self-financing and dynamic replication, which implies that more than just an assumption regarding the terminal distribution of the underlying instrument is needed. We need to model the value of evolution of the underlying over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one of the key assumption for option valuation is how to model the random nature of the underlying instruments. The charactersitic of how the asset evolves is usually thought of being random, a stochastic process. Bachelier proposed to use the <mark>[Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)</mark> to model stock prices. \n",
    "- Key advantages are that it is symmetric, relatively easy to manipulate, zero (bancruptcy) is possible and it is additive (the sum of normal distributions is also normally distributed). You can refer to the section on distributions to find some explanation about this. \n",
    "- Key disadvantage is that negative stock values are theoretically possible, which violates the principle of limited liability of stock ownership.    \n",

Modelling option prices with <mark>[Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion)</mark> implies a log-normal distribution of returns, meaning that the continuously compounded logarithmic return is normally distributed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Essentially, a variable x (stock price returns in this case) has a log-normal distribution if log(x) is normally distributed. A stochastic process $S_T$ is said to follow a GBM if it satisfies the following <mark>[stochastic differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation)</mark> (SDE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$ dS_t = \\mu S_t\\,dt + \\sigma S_t\\,dW_t $\n",

    "\n",
    "The former is used to model deterministic trends, while the latter term is used to model a set of unpredictable events occurring during this motion. The random component of Geometric Brownian motion is determined by volatilty ($\\sigma$), which reflects the annualized standard deviation of continuously compounded percentage changes in the underlying. Note that as a particular sample drifts upward, we observe more variability in absolute terms and less variability if it drifts downwards. This can also be seen in the chart below. The lowest lines are a lot less erratic than the highest lines. This is a simply result of a 10% move in the underlying when the price is 100, corresponds to a move of 10, whereas if the underying price is 10, the move is only 1. While these movements are rather erratic, there are no large jumps, another common feature with marketable financial instruments.   \n",

    "Another appealing feature is that GBM can never hit zero or go below it. This property is very appealing because many financial instruments enjoy limited liability and cannot be be negative. However, with very low or even negative interest rates in some countries, it is no longer reasonable or even [possible](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/fininst/work-with-negative-interest-rates.html) to use a model that does not allow negative rates. We will not delve into this much detail here, as [interest rate models](https://www.fincad.com/blog/interest-rate-models-and-negative-rates) require modifications of the BSM model, with or without negative interest rates.

    "The BSM model can be described as the present value of the expected option payoff at expiration. The present value term in this context is simply $e^{-rT}$. The expectation is based on <mark>risk-neutral probability</mark> as explained above. Just like the binomial model, the BSM model can be desribed as having two components:   \n",
    "- stock component which is $SN(d_1)$ for calls and $S-N(-d_1)$ for puts \n",
    "- bond component which is $e^{-rT}XN(d_2)$ for calls and $e^{-rT}XN(-d_2)$ for puts    \n",
    "\n",
    "The BSM call value is the stock component minus the bond component, $c = SN(d_1) -e^{-rT}XN(d_2)$ . For puts, it is the bond component minus the stock component $p = e^{-rT}XN(-d_2) - SN(-d_1)$. This is a result of the replication strategy where the BSM model can be interpreted as a dynamically managed portfolio of stock and bond components, with the goal to replicate the option payoff. This logic is identical to the binomial model explained above. Instead of the hedge ratio, we have the standard normal distribution that determines the amount. You buy stock, with an amount equal to $N(d_1)$ and finance it by borring money for calls. Therefore, a call option can be viewed as a leveraged position in the stock. On the other hand, for puts, you short sell stock with an amount equal to $N(-d_1)$ and buy bonds with the proceeds, which means you are effectively lending money. The price of the zero coupon bond is $e^{-rT}X$. If appropriately rebalanced, this strategy will replicate the payoff of the call or put option respectively. If the value of the underlying, S, increases, the value of $N(d_1)$ also increases because S has a positive effect on $d_1$. Therefore, the replicating strategy for calls requires continually buying shares in rising markets and selling shares in falling markets. The aggregate losses of \"buy high/sell low\" over the life of the option add up exactly to the BSM model option premium at inception. This is an implication of the no-arbitrage pricing.   \n",

    "### Implied volatility  \n",
    "It is a good place to reconsider the assumptions of the BSM model here. Recall that transaction costs are assumed to be zero (frictionless markets), which in fact, they are not. Frequently rebalancing by buying and selling the underlying adds significant costs for the hedger. Furthermore, markets can often move discontinuously and do not trade 24/7. Hence, in reality, hedges are imperfect. Also, volatility is not constant and known in advance. For this reason, options are frequently more expensive and the <mark>implied volatility</mark> (often just called volatility of vol) used in the option pricing is usually higher than the volatility of the underlying. **include VOLC screenshot or equity or both** \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> \n",
    "You may have learned that implied volatility is a result of the option pricing model. That is true in the original BSM model, where listed option prices are used as an input. However, in <mark>[over-the-counter (OTC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp)</mark> option trading, participants use volatility as the medium in which to quote options. In this case, options are generally priced by using implied volatility as an input for reason we will elaborate below. \n",
    "</div>   \n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility is not directly observable. You can estimate it based on a sample of historical data. However, the volatility parameter $\\sigma$ in the BSM model is future volatility. Much like yield to maturity with bonds, volatility can be inferred from option prices, which is why the term implied volatility is used. Therefore, for listed options, implied volatility provides information regarding the perceived uncertainty going forward, thereby allowing us to get an understanding of the collective opinions of investors on the volatility of the underlying and the demand for options.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice it is very common to observe different implied volatilities for different exercise prices and calls versus puts with the same term. The shape of the <mark>[volatility surface](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stock-analysis/081916/volatility-surface-explained.asp)</mark> with respect to the exercise price is commonly known as the volatility <mark>[smile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile)</mark>.  Implied volatility also varies across time to expiration known as the <mark>term structure of volatility</mark>. During crises, the higher implied volatility is a result of the combined effect of higher expected future volatility and increased preference ofr buying, rather than selling options, which drives up the price of options, and hence volatility.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In OTC markest, the price is calculated by using implied volatility as an input. There are severl benefits of quoting via implied volatility:    \n",
    "- it allows volatility to be traded in its own right  \n",
    "- it is always annualized and therefore easily comparable across exercise prices and expiration dates: you will always know that 20% implies vol is higher than 10% but it is difficult to determine if a deep OTM option is relatively more expensive than an ATM option if you only look at the price  \n",
    "- implied volatility, together with standard pricing models give the market consensus valuation: there are calls and puts, various exercise prices, various maturities, American and European options (as well as more exotic options), exchange traded options and OTC options; thus, it is difficult to conceptualize all these different prices - it is easier to understand and compare option prices when looking at implied volatility (e.g. saying an option trades for $\\dollar$15.85 reveals nothing about its relative price which depends on the moneyness and the remaining life of the option; by looking at annualized implied volatility, the investor has a directly comparable metric)\n",
    "- quoted implied vol can account for a number of shortcomings of the BSM model   \n",
    "\n",
    "The last point is crucial. In reality, log returns do not exactly follow a normal distribution but frequenty exhibit <mark>[skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness)</mark> and <mark>[kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis)</mark>. Skewness and Kurtosis are the third and fourth [moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics). We already encountered the first (mean $\\mu$) and second (standard deviation $\\sigma$) in our discussion about the standard normal distribution. Skewness is related to differences in the prices (implied vol) of call versus put options and is a result of market sentiment as well as the supply and demand relationship. Kurtosis on the other hand, if <mark>leptokurtic</mark> states that the likelyhood of outliers is higher than the normal distribution suggests. Recall that based on the normal distribution, we showed that 99.7% of all observations fall within the $\\pm3 SD$ band. If the distribution is leptokurtic, the probability of values that fall outside the 3 SD band is higher than 0.3 (100-99.7). Clearly, if real world returns exhibit skewness and kurtosis, using a single implied volatility quote would not be ideal. Therefore, the market develloped tools that account for this shortcoming. We will illustrate this by explaining how implied volatility is quoted in FX option markets.    "

    "### Black option valuation model   \n",
    "In 1976, [Fischer Black](https://www.scribd.com/document/105258441/3-The-pricing-of-commodity-contracts) introduced a modified version of the BSM model that can be used on underlying instruments that are costless to carry, such as options of <mark>futures contracts</mark> or <mark>forward contracts</mark>. A slightly modified version can also be used for interest rate based options such as [caps, floors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_cap_and_floor) and [swaptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaption).   \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of carry is summarizing the relationship between spot and future prices. It is a measure of the carry benefits (fore example, dividends, foreign interest rates, bond coupon payments and so forth) and carry costs (for example storage costs, waste for example form spoilage, insurance; which mainly apply to commodities and are essentially 0 for finanicial instruments). Let $\\gamma$ denote carry benefits, and $\\theta$ denote carry costs. While there are no direct carry costs for finanical instruments, there are still opportunity costs of the interest that could be earned on the money tied up in the asset. Thus, financing costs that come form the rate of interest and teh carry cost that are common to physical assets are equivalent concepts. The carry arbitrage model with continuous compounding is the future value F of the underlying S adjusted for carry and can be expressed as:     \n",
    "\n",
    "$F_0(T) = S_0e^{(r_c+\\theta -\\gamma)*T}$ where $F_0(T)$ denotes the future value today, for expiry at time T    \n",
    "\n",
    "This holds in general for all forward and future contracts with some modifications. For example, in the case of bond futures, you need an adjustment for delivery of multiple bonds called conversion factor and if you use the clean price you need an additional adjustment for this. Furthermore, forward and future prices are not identical due to differences in margin requirements, mark-to market features, centralized clearing and so forth. We will not delve into the exact differences but only provide a simple example. Consider a case where the underlying is highly positively correlated with interest rates. Therefore, when S increases, an investor who holds a long futures position makes an immediate gain because of the daily settlement procedure. This gain will tend to be invested at a higher than average interest rate. Likewise, if S decreases, the investor will make an immediate loss which will tend to be financed at a lower than average interest rate. An ivestor holding a forward contract rather than a futures contract will be unaffected by this. It follows that long futures contracts should be more attractive compared to the forward contract. Similarly, if S is negatively correlated with interest rates, the exact opposite holds. In any case, the futures contract is already reflecting the carry arbitrage price. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### European options on Futures   \n",
    "It is still assumed that the futures price follows a geometric Brownian motion. Ignoring issues like margin requirements and marking to market, Black proposed the following model for European-style futures options:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- $c = e^{-rT}[F_0(T)N(d_1) - XN(d_2)]$ for calls and \n",
    "- $p = e^{-rT}[XN(-d_2) - F_0(T)N(-d_1)]$ for puts,  \n",
    "\n",
    "where   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $d_1 = \\frac{ln[F_0(T)/X] + (\\sigma^2/2)T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$\n",
    "- $d_2 = d_1 -\\sigma \\sqrt{t}$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing Black's model with the BSM model shows that it is simply the BSM model in which the futures contract is assumed to reflect the carry arbirtage model. Similar to the BSM model, we can describe the call option as two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- futures component which is $F_0(T)e^{-rT}N(d_1)$ for calls and $F_0(T)e^{-rT}N(-d_1)$ for puts \n",
    "- bond component which is again $e^{-rT}XN(d_2)$ for calls and $e^{-rT}XN(-d_2)$ for puts    \n",
    "\n",
    "The Black call value is the future component minus the bond component and for puts, it is the bond component minus the futures component. This is a result of the replication strategy where the Black model can be interpreted as a dynamically managed portfolio of futures and bond components, with the goal to replicate the option payoff. This logic is identical to the binomial model as well as the BSM model explained above. However, there is a simpler interpretation here. The futures option value is simply the present value of the difference between the futures price and the exercise price adjusted for N(x).    \n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff from a European spot call option is $max(S_T - X,0)$ where $S_T$ is the spot price at maturity. The payoff from a European futures call option with the sam strike X is $max(F_0(T)-x,0)$. If the European Futures option matures at the same time as the futures contract we have $F_T =S_T$ and the two options are in theory equivalent. At expiration, both a forward and future contract are equivalent to a spot transaction in the underlying. This property is often called <mark>[convergence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convergence.asp)</mark>.    \n",
    "However, Black's formula does not require that the options contract and the futures contract mature at the same time. If the European call futures opton matures before the futures contract, it is worth more than the corresponding spot option if the futures price is higher than the spot price (a situation called <mark>[contango](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contango.asp)</mark>) and less than the corresponding spot option in an inverted market where the futures price is below the spot price (a situation called <mark>[backwardation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backwardation.asp)</mark>). A similar argument holds for put options, with teh opposite direction. If the put option matures before the futures contract and the market is in contango, it is worth less, if the market is in backwardation it is worth more. "
